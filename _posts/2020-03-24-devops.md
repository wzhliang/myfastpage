# General
* technical practice **PLUS** culture value
* term coined in 2008
    * after SRE is coined, which happend in 2003
    * Patrick Debois, who’s often called “the father of DevOps”, coined the word “DevOps” in 2009
* IT performance metrics
    * **MTTR**: mean time to recover (total maintenance time / total number of repairs)
        * actually **when** the failure happens can be important too
    * **lead time** to change: time from code commit to production deployment
    * **deployment frequency**
        * NOTE: deploy doesn't necessarily mean new feature for customer, which
          can be a business decision
    * **change failure rate**
    * **MTTD**: mean time to detect failure
    * **MTBF**: mean time between failures
    * [four key metrics](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/four-key-metrics)
        * lead time, deploy frequency, MTTR, change failure rate
* deliver stuff faster and more reliably, **AT THE SAME TIME**
* same (similar) process for dev and ops team
* take failure for granted
* open source first
    * write software and first choice is to open source it
* Melvin Conway
    * _organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations_
* Catchpoint
    *  _Continuous Delivery is about provisioning and configuring test environments to match production as closely as possible, automatically_
* _“DevOps is a cultural shift whereby developers are aware of how their applications are run in a production environment and the operations folks are aware and empowered to know how the application works so that they can actively play a part in making the application more reliable.”_
    * from [joe beda](https://www.madrona.com/the-remaking-of-enterprise-infrastructure-investment-themes-for-next-generation-cloud/)
* _"The nature of a large, complex organization is to fall out of alignment without deliberate effort"_
    * Damon Edwards
* _"The goal of any process improvements is to shorten and amplify feedback loops"_
* _"DevOps is the application of Agile methodology to system administration"_
    * Tom Limoncelli
* _"DevOps is a software development approach where development and operations are working together to deliver software to end users in a fast and reliable way."_
    * [from here](https://sellegi.se/glossary/devops/)
    * also mentions 5 pillars
* _“Whatever definition you might have, you are not wrong because there is no official definition of DevOps.”_
    * agile has manifesto, no such thing for DevOps
    * Rodriguez Pardo
    * [newstack](https://thenewstack.io/want-devops-automation-its-people-before-pipelines/
    * _“DevOps is not a tool or a process, but a practice that values continuous **communication**, **collaboration**, **integration**, and **automation** across an organization.”_
* _DevOps is continous improvement towards the same goal across an organization_
    * yours truely
* _DevOps is about taking a business idea and helping the business realize that idea ASAP_
* VSM - Value Stream Mapping
    *  a flowchart method used to illustrate, analyze, and improve the steps required to deliver a product or service to customers
    * [from here](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/value-stream-mapping-for-devops)
* ARA - Application Release Automation
* CAB - change approval board
    * bad, heavy
* SDET - Software Developer Engineer in Test
* release orchestration???
* CALMS model, or CAMS model
    * culture - people > process > tools
    * automation
    * lean
    * metrics
    * sharing - collaboration/feedback
        * open source
        * share responsibility!!!
    * In 2010, John Willis and Damon Edwards coined the term CAMS:
* 7C of DevOps
    * communication
    * collaboration
    * controlled process
    * CI
    * CD
    * continous testing
    * continous monitoring
* SDO performance
    * software delivery and operation performance
    * used to be called IT performance
* Westrum organizational culture
    * Ron Westrum was a sociologist who found that organizational culture was predictive of safety and performance outcomes in the healthcare industry.
    * [nice table](https://continuousdelivery.com/implementing/culture/)
* wall of confusion
    * wall between dev and ops
* TAM - total addressable market
* DevOps Assembly Lines
    * replaces CI pipeline
    * _DevOps Assembly Lines are focused on automating and connecting activities performed by several teams, such as CI for devs, infrastructure provisioning and config mgmt for Ops, test automation for Test, security patching for SecOps, semantic versioning and approval gates for Release Managers, deployments for multiple environments, and so on._
    * [shippable](http://blog.shippable.com/the-difference-between-ci-pipelines-and-devops-assembly-lines-0)
* Immutable Infrastructure
    * An immutable infrastructure is another infrastructure paradigm in which servers are never modified after they’re deployed. If something needs to be updated, fixed, or modified in any way, new servers built from a common image with the appropriate changes are provisioned to replace the old ones.
* _shift left_
    * operations concerns move earlier in the software delivery life cycle, toward development 

## Three Way of DevOps
* essentially:
    * Maximize flow
    * Minimize feedback loop time
    * Share learnings
* three ways
    1. entire system performance - work flowing from left to right as fast possible
        * lower WIP as much as possible
            * deliver value piece meal
            * allow faster feedback
        * identify bottle neck
    1. creating feedback loop - increasing the feedback loops from right to left.
    1. continual experiment - culture where constant experimentation and learning is encouraged

## Four Capabilities
<img src="http://borlandc.pek3b.qingstor.com/devops/four-capabilities.png" width="75%">

## Dev Vs Ops
Developers always want to deliver changes as soon as possible. Operations want reliability and stability.

## History
* [a decade old](https://devops.com/the-origins-of-devops-whats-in-a-name/)

## Typical Lifecycle

# Architecture
* loosely coupled architecture to allow autonomous team


# Methodologies
## Automation
* automation is key in devops
* test automation brings the most value
* configuration management automation: me think this is taken care of by
  container
* change approval process can also be automated

## 金丝雀发布 / Canary Release
* canary release
* similar to blue/green release but serves different purpose
* meant for testing out new feature on a subset of users
* also called _phased rollout_ or _incremental rollout_
* __This technique was inspired from the fact that canary birds were once used in coal mines to alert miners when toxic gases reached dangerous levels — the gases would kill the canary before killing the miners, which provides a warning to get out of the mine tunnels immediately.__

* [martin fowler](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html)
* [gitub](https://github.com/Telefonica/nginx-canary)
    * policies: random, or header_authorization
* [dev.to, cloudbee](https://dev.to/cloudbees/canary-deployment-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it-3gfg)
    * term come from old coal mining technique
    * strategies:
        * by user
        * by instance
* [newstack, kublr](https://thenewstack.io/a-primer-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-ci-cd/)
    * _Code and user behavior are continuously monitored. If the error rate or user complaints do not increase, the share of requests routed to the new version is incrementally increased_

## Feature Toggle, Feature Flag
* as opposed to feature branch
* code stays on the main branch but can be configured
* code can be tested even before it's complete
* helps with canary release
* best practice is to break a largish feature into smaller testable pieces
* A feature flag is a way to change your software’s functionality without changing and re-deploying your code.
* drawbacks
    * add noise into code
    * flag needs to be tested

## Trunk Based Development
* small and frequent change commited to **trunk** (main branch)
* in theory, the main branch can be released at any time safely
* hard to do right but provides a lot of value when done right
* closely aligned to continuous integration goal
* feature toggle instead of feature branch
* [paulhammant](https://paulhammant.com/2013/04/05/what-is-trunk-based-development/)
    * what is TBD
* [stxnext](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/02/28/escape-merge-hell-why-i-prefer-trunk-based-development-over-feature-branching-and-gitflow/)
    * escape merge hell
* [tw](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/enabling-trunk-based-development-deployment-pipelines)
    * enabling TBD
* [branch for release](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/branch-for-release/)
    * shortly before the release
    * fix bugs on trunk
    * cherry-pick to release branch
* [toptal](https://www.toptal.com/software/trunk-based-development-git-flow)
    * git flow vs TBD
    * senior vs junior dev crap

## CI/CD
* shorten feedback loop
* reduce lead time
* automation

## CD vs CD

* from Accenture
* somebody actually think the reverse

### Different Kind of CI

### Example CI/CD Pipeline
<img src="http://borlandc.pek3b.qingstor.com/devops/ci-cd-jenkins-helm-k8s.png" width="75%">


## Security
* SecOps
* DevSecOps
* bake security into DevOps process

## XXX as Code
* version control everything

## Lean Product Management
* build MVP all the time

## Self Service Environment
* developer create test env by themselves


# Culture and Organization
* break down silo
* autonomous team
    * important decision can be made within the team itself
* build quality in
* tight feedback loop

## Tribes, Squads, Chapters and Guilds
* originated from Spotify
* chapter
    * people with similar sill set. e.g. database, front end, tester
    * chapter lead is a line manager
* squad
    * similar to an agile team, includes people from different chapters
* tribe
    * a collection of squad that sits together?
    * for large organizations, with 100+ people
* guild
    * ??? how is it different from chapter?
* [full stack agile](http://www.full-stackagile.com/2016/02/14/team-organisation-squads-chapters-tribes-and-guilds/)

## Transformational Leader
* ...


# For FinTech
* more regulated environment, more security concerns
    * makes stuff like chaos monkey harder to do
* deployment triggered directly by developer push is no no in financial
  organisation
    * actual production deployment should be manual
* window of after hour maintainance
    * for trading companies


# Tools / Ansible
* procedural but declarative
* runs over SSH
* written in Python, so installable via `pip`
* uses template engine for configuration files, etc.
    * Jinja2
* ansible prints out log only **after** the operation is finished!!!
* package management
    * `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`

## Terms
* *inventory* file list all relevant hosts
    * host can be grouped
    * it's possible to assign variable to a group
* *playbook* is a YAML formatted file that lists what to do to a certain server
    * an execution plan
    * `hosts: []`
    * `remote_user: who`
    * `tasks`
    * `roles` are a name that's bind to a list of tasks, etc.
* *modules* extends functionality of Ansible
    * a program (usually python) that executes, does some work and returns proper JSON output
    * ping, shell, command, file, raw, git, atp, etc
    * `ansible -m ping localhost`
    * `ansible -m shell -a 'date; whoami' localhost`
* *task* is a module in running
    * `main.yml` is the entry point
    * task should be idempotent, see `changed_when, always_run, when`
* *play* is an ordered set of tasks
* *role* is a structured way to manage your set of tasks, variables, handlers, default settings,
* *handlers* are lists of tasks that are notified by notifiers to handle event
    * triggered by `notify:` in tasks
* *callback*
    * custom action when a event happens, e.g. when a play starts, or task complete
* *when*
    * express conditional
* *register*
    * dynamically generate variables
* *tag*
    * task, role, etc, can be tagged to form some kinda grouping
* *block*
    * cut down repetitive tasks directives
    * like macro

## Arch
<img src="http://borlandc.pek3b.qingstor.com/devops/ansible-arch.png" width="75%">

## Syntax
* `vars`
    * define variables using `apache2_log_level: "warn"` like K/V
    * 21 levels of variable precedence: [1](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable)
* `regisgter` can be used to generate varialbe content from task
    * E.g. `register: root_size`
* `defaults`
    * assumes to define default values
* `when`
    * express conditional
    * E.g `when: some_variable in 'a string'`
* `become`
    * set to ‘true’/’yes’ to activate privilege escalation.
    * `become: True`
* `set_fact`
    * set host fact from task
    * a bit like `vars`, can be used in template

    * 96 pages long slides

# SRE
* different from DevOps, which has more to do with culture, SRE is an actual role
    * _SRE is to DevOps what Scrum is to Agile_
* four golden signals
    * latency
    * traffic
    * errors
    * saturation
* [from google SRE book](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals)
* [infoq](https://www.infoq.com/articles/monitoring-SRE-golden-signals)
    * also mention USE, RED
    * golden signal for various different things like Python, MySQL
    * USE: utilisation, saturation, error
    * RED: rate, error, duration
    * RULES: request rate, utilisation, latency, errors rate, saturation
* [hn, hacker](https://medium.com/hackernoon/sre-vs-devops-the-dilemma-f7054714525c)
    * pretty good comparison between SRE and DevOps
    * DevOps engineer mostly means sysadmin


# GitOps
* declarative spec for environment version controlled in git
    * code
    * configuration
    * monitoring rules
    * policies, etc
* the canonical desired system state is versioned
* auditability
* approved changes to the desired state are automatically applied to the system
* agents ensure correctness and alert on diverge
    * agents = gitops operator
* provent process like PR, code review etc can be used for ops
* basically more automation
* catches
    * one per cluster
    * database deployment where config is not in git?
* _“Imagine a world where every time you do a deployment, it’s correct. And if it’s not correct, then the deployment fails completely, so you can try again or make other intelligent decisions. … That is just an incredible cost-saver in operational overhead. Moving from an unsafe, semi-reliable system to one that is basically more robust.”_

# DevOps Metrics
* see Tricentis-eBook-Forrester-DevOps-Quality-Metrics.pdf in `dropbox://eBook/devops`
* measure what matters

## Code Churn
* Code churn is a measure that tells you the rate at which your code evolves.

## Test Hygiene
* ???


# AIOps
* AIOps is the application of artificial intelligence for IT operations
* _The goal is to turn the data generated by IT systems platforms into meaningful insights._
* analyze big data from various IT operation tools
* optimise test cases, determining which to run and not run on each build. 
* predict hardware failures before they occur.
